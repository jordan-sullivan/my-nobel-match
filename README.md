# Rancid Tomatillos : Movie Viewer

For this solo project, the goal was to create a React application that allows users to browse through a collection of movies and see what peaks their interest. They may also sort movies from best to worst by rating, and vice versa with the click of a button. Users can click on a specific movie from the home page and the movie's details will render to a second page. The user can use the functional back arrow or click the Home button to return to the home page. Check it out the project [deployed on Heroku here](https://rancid-tomatillos-movie-viewer.herokuapp.com/) !

## Project Specs

My Nobel Match is a React application that uses React Router built in 6 days at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/). The goal of this solo [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html) was to solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

- React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS using Cypress
- Refactor conditional rendering to create a multi page UX using React Router


## Illustrations

### View All Movies & Sort by Rating
A user may browse a collection of movies on the main page

When a user clicks on the Sort by Rating button, they can view movie ratings from lowest to highest and vice versa

When a user clicks on a specific movie, they will be routed to another page to view movie's details

## Setup

- In your terminal, clone the repo
- `https://github.com/jordan-sullivan/rancid-tomatillos.git`
- Make a new directory and cd into it
- Install NPM packages
- `npm install`
- Do NOT run `npm audit fix --force`
- Then type `npm start` . This runs the app in the development mode.
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
- The browser should then deploy using a local host
- Enjoy using Rancid Tomatillos!
- NOTE: Make sure that you type Control + C in your terminal when you are done using the application. This ensure the server will stop running before your close your Terminal.
- Start the server to see the local site `npm start`


## Project Management

- I used a [Github Project Board](https://github.com/jordan-sullivan/rancid-tomatillos/projects/1) to stay on task and meet the deadline as well as had check-ins with my mentor. 

## Future Features

- Add search bar or dropdown to have ability to search a movie by its Title
- Allow a user to search movies by genres on the main page 
- Ability for a user to add their own rating to a movie
- Responsive design to allow for better UX/UI on mobile devices

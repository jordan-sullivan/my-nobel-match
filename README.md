# My Nobel Match
### A quiz to see which Nobel laureate you are most similar to! 

For this solo project, the goal was to create a React application that allows 9th grade students the capability to take a short 10 question quiz to see which Nobel Laureate they are most similar to. The aim is to help students connect to these incredible minds through a simple quiz. After users get through the quiz, they are navigated to their results page and are able to see the fields and categories which link them. Users can click learn more about their match by clicking a link to an external site. Check it out the project [deployed on Heroku here](https://my-nobel-match.herokuapp.com/) !

## Project Specs

My Nobel Match is a React application that uses React Router built in 6 days at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/). The goal of this solo [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html) was to solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

- React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS using Cypress
- Create multi page UX using React Router
- PropTypes


## Illustrations

### Home Page and The Quiz
A user is welcomed to the home page and encouraged to begin quiz. The user selects true or false and then navigates to the next page.

## Setup

- In your terminal, clone the repo
- `https://github.com/jordan-sullivan/my-nobel-match.git`
- Make a new directory and cd into it
- Install NPM packages
- `npm install`
- Do NOT run `npm audit fix --force`
- Then type `npm start` . This runs the app in the development mode.
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
- The browser should then deploy using a local host
- Enjoy using My Nobel Match!
- NOTE: Make sure that you type Control + C in your terminal when you are done using the application. This ensure the server will stop running before your close your Terminal.
- Start the server to see the local site `npm start`


## Project Management

- I used a [Github Project Board](https://github.com/users/jordan-sullivan/projects/11) to stay on task and meet the deadline as well as had check-ins with my mentor. 

## Future Features

- Inform the user if their answer was right or wrong in real time as they hit the submit button
- Allow a user to search through laureates in a drop-down list to learn more about them 
- Responsive design to allow for better UX/UI on tablets / mobile devices
